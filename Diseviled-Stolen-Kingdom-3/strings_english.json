scene2_princess3: Excellent, hurry up!,
scene3_princess1: One more door, crash it with regular attack!,
scene4_princess1: Stop! You will not pass here easily!,
scene4_princess2: Crush these thorny weeds using lightnings!,
scene4_princess3: He-He,
scene4_princess4: It was powerful. Catch up!,
scene5_princess1: Be careful, again these weeds, you can burn them with fire.,
scene5_hero1: How do you cross them?,
scene5_princess2: Probably, I'm just lucky, I don't know, hurry up!,
scene6_princess1: Fierce wolves!,
scene6_princess2: They will tear us!,
scene6_hero1: The way is clear, run!,
scene7_enemy1: The attack is at the height, and since you lost the map we can't find this foolish castle!,
scene7_enemy2: Excuse me, sir, we have to capture the castle not far away from there, could you tell where is it?,
scene7_enemy3: Otherwise, we will rip your guts out!,
scene7_enemy4: Oh, excuse my friend, tell us, please, which way is the castle from here? We are late for its capture.,
scene7_hero1: You passed by it long time ago, turn back, to the left, to the right, straight, straight, to the left, to the right, across the bridge and through the forest. Have you understood?,
scene7_enemy5: Erm… I think so, thanks.,
scene7_princess1: Oh, no, it's true, we must hurry up.,
scene7_hero2: It's dangerous for you, stay here.,
scene7_princess2: Don't even think about it, I will save my kingdom.,
scene8_king1: Oh no, why did you return, I thought you were in safety?!,
scene8_hero1: No time to explain, we must go away, the castle is captured.,
scene8_knightBoss1: No! We mustn't give up! If the king is destined to die then he will die here.,
scene8_princess1: Definitely not, we all should go away right now! Mage will take us away.,
scene8_king2: Princess is right, I don't want to die.,
scene9_hero1: What happened? Where we are?,
scene9_king1: In the same place where we were. These demons stole everything! Gold, crown, EVEN MY CASTLE!,
scene9_hero2: And what happened to the princess?,
scene9_king2: Ah, yes. They also kidnaped her… My girl… My crown…,
scene9_hero3: I will set everything right and the princess will come back!,
scene9_king3: And don't forget about the crown. And the castle. And the treasury. Have I already told about the crown? That's all, hurry up!,
scene9_king4: A great reward awaits you.,
scene9_hero5: I constantly hear it.,
scene1_1_npc_guard1: Hey, help me to close the gate. We will block up the demons in the village!,
scene1_1_hero1: And where are the residents of the village?,
scene1_1_npc_guard2: They are inside, we will escape while the demons are occupied with them, come on!,
scene1_1_npc_guard3: What the heck!,
scene1_2_enemy1: *screeching*,
scene1_2_hero1: Oh, excellent, I can drink some water!,
scene1_2_npc_civilian_man1: Psst, fellow, is it you who kills demons?,
scene1_2_hero2: Yes… and where are you?,
scene1_2_npc_civilian_man2: I'm here, in the well, we were blocked up in  cages underground, save us!,
scene1_2_hero3: How can I find you?,

scene1_2_npc_civilian_man4: You saved us, thanks.,
scene1_2_hero4: I'm in a hurry, open the gate and I'll go away.,
scene1_2_npc_civilian_man5: You know, this place is so safe, we will leave the village's gate closed.,
scene1_2_hero5: And how can I get out from there?,
scene1_2_npc_civilian_man6: There is a secret passage, through the caves, it's more dangerous, but you will cope with it. Let's go, I'll show it.,
scene1_3_enemy_arrow1: EXCELLENT EXPLOSION!,
scene1_3_enemy_bomb1: WHAT!? I CAN HEAR NOTHING! LOOK AT MY NEW BOMB!,
scene1_3_enemy_bomb2: EXCELLENT EXPLOSION! COOL BOMB! HAHA!,
scene1_3_npc_civilian_man1: Here! Come here the demons killer, the exit is here.,
scene1_3_hero1: Who are you?,
scene1_3_npc_civilian_man2: I'm… erm… a local resident and I want to help. Hurry up, you must run.,
scene1_3_hero2: Thanks.,
scene1_3_enemy_wizard1: Yes, go to meet your death! HAHA!,
scene1_4_boss_hero1: This cave is endless, are you sure it is the way to the exit?,
scene1_4_boss_stupidBoss1: No. You. Make a turn here. That's right.,
scene1_4_boss_hero2: Hi! Are you a peaceful troll who can show me the exit?,
scene1_4_boss_stupidBoss2: No. I kill people. Must kill you.,
scene1_5_hero1: Fresh air at last!,
scene1_5_enemy1: This is the end of the way… as well as yours... AHAHA!,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_man1: No, please.,
scene1_5_hero2: We need to help them!,
scene1_5_hero3: Are you all right?,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_girl1: Yes, thank you.,
scene1_5_hero4: Tell me, please, have you seen… ahem… the flying castle?,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_girl2: Yes, I have, it flew in that direction!,
scene1_5_hero5: Thanks, then it's time for me to go.,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_girl3: Please, save my father, the demons are keeping him in the house, they… they are forcing him...,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_girl4: To wash their underpants… *crying*,
scene1_5_hero6: Brutes! I'll save him, do not be afraid.,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_old: Thank you.,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_girl5: My father is alive!,
scene1_5_npc_civilian_man2: That's for you, a little reward.,
scene1_6_npc_guard_h1: Stop right there, demon! Stay away! Otherwise, I'll show you!,
scene1_6_hero1: I'm a demon hunter and I am pursuing the king's castle!,
scene1_6_npc_guard_h2: I saw the castle, it landed not far from the village.,
scene1_6_npc_guard_h3: But I won't let you pass, demon! Give up!,
scene1_6_hero2: – Oh, I'm not a demon!,
scene1_6_npc_civilian_women1: – Den! The demons were seen in the sewage, we need to clean it up!,
scene1_6_npc_guard_h4: I have already cought one!  Let's tie it up!,
scene1_6_hero3: Oh… I have no time for this. Yes, I'm a demon! Arrrr! I'll eat you rigth now! Arrrr! Better run away!,
scene1_6_npc_guard_h5: Aaaah! Run away!,
scene1_6_npc_civilian_women2: You really are a hunter. But still the demons captured our village.,
scene1_6_hero4: I'll cope with them, wait for me at the exit of the village.,
scene1_6_hero5: The village is cleared, and now show me where the castle is.,
scene1_6_npc_civilian_women3: But the whole army is around and inside, maybe, let's forget about this castle, let them take it, the king will build a new one then.,
scene1_6_hero6: I want to save the princess.,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss1: Are you a hunter?,
scene1_7_hero1: Erm... no, me? Definitely not. No.,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss2: You aren't good at lying, hunter. I'm a spirit of this forest. Usually I don't show myself to people.,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss3: Demons threaten me with a destruction of my forest  in that case if I don't kill you. Nothing personal.,
scene1_7_hero2: What if we come to an agreement or you will help me to defeat them?,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss4: No, hunter, sorry, I'll try to do everything quickly.,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss5: Well, why are you standing?,
scene1_7_hero3: You aren't dead?,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss6: Of course, I am not, being a human you can't kill me, but still I don't want to work for demons.,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss7: I'll just pretend to be dead.,
scene1_7_hero4: Wise idea.,
scene1_7_boss_wolfBoss8: Go away. Your castle is farther to the north.,
scene2_1_enemy_red1: Pizza delivery? It seems you came too early.,
scene2_1_hero1: Erm... Yes. Your order. With anchovies and mushrooms.,
scene2_1_enemy_red2: That's it, I'll pull the rope right now, climb up.,
scene2_1_enemy_wizard1: Hey! Infantry! Wake up! Stop sleeping, the enemy is in the house!  What I pay you for, idlers!,
scene2_1_enemy_wizard2: And wake your friends up!,
scene2_1_enemy_sceleton1: a-a-ah… e-e-eh…,
scene2_1_enemy_wizard3: Entirely withered brain!,
scene2_1_enemy1: Stop! I'm on your side.,
scene2_1_hero2: I don't understand. What?,
scene2_1_enemy2: I'm a spy. I have been living under cover among the demons for 15 years. I created my family and have children here.,
scene2_1_hero3: Would you help me?,
scene2_1_enemy3: I can't reveal myself. I can only say that we were betrayed. But I don't know who did that.,
scene2_1_enemy4: Oh yes, take this crystal from the royal treasury, I think it will prove more useful to you.,
scene2_1_hero4: Thanks.,
scene2_3_boss_hero1: Golden Knight! Is it you?! It is so good that I found you!,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss1: ...,
scene2_3_boss_hero2: Golden Knight? Hey… Have you seen the princess?,

scene2_3_boss_knightBoss2: Because now it's mine!,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss3: And the princess is also mine. And the kingdom. Everything is mine now. Everything is mine! Ha-ha-ha!,
scene2_3_boss_hero4: This all belongs to demons now. You're a fool.,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss4: It is you who is a fool!,
scene2_3_boss_hero5: You!,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss5: You!,
scene2_3_boss_hero6: Me!,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss6: Me!,

scene2_3_boss_knightBoss8: Wow, wow, stop! You're an excellent warrior.,
scene2_3_boss_hero8: Yes, I know it.,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss9: You know, I have just remembered about an important metter... to sign the documents...,
scene2_3_boss_knightBoss10: I'll call you later!,
scene2_4_princess1: Did you came for me?,
scene2_4_hero1: Yes. There is no such space where I wouldn't find you.,
scene2_4_princess2: ...,
scene2_4_hero2: ...,
scene2_4_princess3: It's the Golden Knight! He is in collusion with demons. A betrayer.,
scene2_4_hero3: I have already met with him but he managed to escape. I need to help you out from there and to bring your kingdom back.,
scene2_4_enemy_wizard1: Princess, I'm searching for you, where did you ran away, your groom is waiting for you.,
scene2_4_hero4: Princess!,
scene2_4_enemy_wizard2: Why you wouldn't die?!,
scene2_4_hero5: I want to ask you the same question.,
scene2_4_enemy_wizard3: So, it's time to throw away the rubbish. Everything will soon be ready.,

scene2_5_npc_civilian_girl2: He is good, he… saved our village, together we hid all the residents.,
scene2_5_npc_civilian_girl3: Please, don't get your sword.,
scene2_5_hero4: Ok, ok, I'm not a bloodthirsty killer. If you have good relations, then I'm all for it.,
scene2_5_enemy1: Thank you, human. Can I help you?,
scene2_5_hero5: Yes, I need to get to the stolen castle... Again.,
scene2_5_enemy2: Okay, it's not far, I'll lead you there. But the village's gate is closed.,
scene2_5_enemy3: You must open it.,
scene2_6_enemy1: Have you seen the yesterday's game?,
scene2_6_enemy_red1: No, I had been patrolling. All are searching for the insane demon hunter.,
scene2_6_enemy2: Better he would caught soon. I can't sleep at all, I see nightmares.,
scene2_6_enemy3: If I am not mistaken I asked to wait until I open the door.,
scene2_6_hero1: I thought it would be faster.,
scene2_6_enemy4: You're not far from the central hall. It seems like the princess is there. Hurry up.,
scene2_6_knightBoss1: We were waiting for you. I intend to marry the princess and I decided to present her  a wedding gift.,
scene2_6_knightBoss2: Your corpse. ha-ha-ha!,

scene2_6_princess2: You saved me. Get out from here now!,
scene2_6_hero3: No, stay here, I must put an end to this and liberate the castle.,
scene2_6_princess3: Well, that is your job, see you when you finish. I'll be waiting...,
scene2_6_enemy_wizard1: Well. Well. Got it.,
scene2_6_hero4: Are you talking to me?,
scene2_6_enemy_wizard2: Stop talking.,
scene2_6_enemy_wizard3: No, sir, I'm not talking to you…. He is mean as a cockroach and weak as a girl, sir...,
scene2_6_enemy_wizard4: Well, I got everything, I'll bring him alive.,
scene2_6_hero5: Have you finished?,
scene2_6_enemy_wizard5: Yes, I talked to the boss, you see. So, the plans have changed.,
scene2_6_enemy_wizard6: Our boss decided to get through with you by himself. You turned out to be a real problem. But you're hardly a decent mouthful for the boss.,
scene2_7_boss_dragonBoss1: Was I awakened because of it? And my army didn't manage to kill this?,
scene2_7_boss_dragonBoss2: And who are you?,
scene2_7_boss_hero1: I'm diseviled, a demon hunter. And you have stolen the wrong kingdom and kidnaped the wrong princess.,
scene2_7_boss_dragonBoss3: This is my castle! Your miserable king built it on my money. And he didn't return it in time!,
scene2_7_boss_hero2: But your army is destroying villages, killing people.,
scene2_7_boss_dragonBoss4: Have you heard anything about the interest?,
scene2_7_boss_hero3: Well, take the castle, I will take the princess and will go away. Agreed?,
scene2_7_boss_dragonBoss5: What a foolishness. You crushed my army. You affected my sleep. You killed the Troll, the Wolf's Spirit.,
scene2_7_boss_dragonBoss6: Now I must kill you, human! Stay quietly!,
scene2_8_king1: You returned! Come on! Where is the castle? Will it be delivered later? Together with the treasury?,
scene2_8_princess1: Father, there is no more castle and gold, they were destroyed because you hadn't paid the debt! The Golden Knight turned out to be a betrayer!,
scene2_8_king2: And even my crown wasn't saved? My crown...,
scene2_8_princess2: He saved ME, father!,
scene2_8_king3: Ah, yes, sure, sure... ,
scene2_8_king4: So, Mage, I'll reward you with a great present all the same! ,
scene2_8_king5: You got the honour to receive the king with his daughter at home. It is the reward to the valiant warrior, isn't it? ,
scene2_8_hero1: Erm.. Yes, of course... It's such honour, thank you... I think I can't accept it... ,
scene2_8_king6: No, no, everything is settled, move out right now! ,
